# Overview

I'm working to improve my programming skills through various languages and system designs. Currently, as a student at BYU-Idaho, I'm studying for a Software Development major.

This software is a brief Hello World example written in Python.

The software gives a brief reference to my use of Python in my programming projects.

Here is a link to a demo of this software.

This was developed using VS Code and then uploaded to GitHub.

I used Python for the programming language.
